# Camry-E-COmmerce-Sales-Dashboard PowerBI
Overview: Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize e-commerce sales data for Camry, focusing on revenue, profit, quantity sold, and customer behavior. The dashboard provides insights into performance across categories, regions, payment methods, and time periods to drive sales optimization and strategic planning.
Data Source: Analyzed a sales dataset including metrics like total amount (438K), quantity sold (5,615 units), profit (37K), and average order value (AOV: 121K). Data segmented by categories (Clothing, Electronics, Furniture), sub-categories (e.g., Printers, Sarees), states, customers, payment modes, months, and quarters.
Key Analyses Performed:
**Overall KPIs: Total sales amount, quantity, profit, and AOV.
Profit trends by month (bar chart showing variations from January to December, with peaks around 10K in some months).
Profit by sub-category (e.g., Printers leading at ~10K+, followed by Bookcases and Sarees).
Quantity distribution by category (Clothing at 63%, Electronics 21%, Furniture 17%).
Quantity by payment mode (COD at 44%, UPI 21%, Debit Card 13%, Credit Card 12%, EMI 10%).
Sales amount by state (e.g., Maharashtra highest at ~0.1M+, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi).
Sales amount by top customers (e.g., Harivansh at ~10K, Madhav, Madan Mohan, Shiva).
Quarterly filters (Qtr 1-4) for slicing data across time periods.

Tools and Techniques Used: Power BI for data connection, modeling, DAX measures (e.g., sums, averages), and visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and slicers for interactive filtering by quarter.
Key Insights and Findings:

Clothing dominated sales volume (63% of quantity), indicating a core strength in apparel like Sarees, while Electronics (e.g., Printers, Accessories) drove higher profits.
COD was the preferred payment method (44%), suggesting opportunities to promote digital options like UPI for faster processing.
Regional focus: Maharashtra led in sales, highlighting potential for targeted marketing or expansion in high-performing states like Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
Monthly profit fluctuations (e.g., dips in mid-year) point to seasonal trends, with possible inventory adjustments needed for low-profit months.
Top customers like Harivansh contributed significantly, enabling loyalty programs to retain high-value buyers.
High AOV (121K) relative to total sales suggests premium pricing or bundled offerings, but profit margins (37K on 438K sales) indicate room for cost efficiencies.


Skills Demonstrated: Data visualization, ETL in Power BI, DAX for advanced calculations, dashboard design with interactivity, and extracting business insights from sales data.
Outcome: Produced a dynamic, filterable dashboard that empowers stakeholders to monitor KPIs, identify growth opportunities, and make informed decisions on inventory, marketing, and customer engagement. This project illustrates my expertise in using Power BI to convert raw e-commerce data into actionable business intelligence.
